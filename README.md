SPIRIT is a puzzle 2.5D platformer game developed with Unity and Blender that explores the theme of academic pressure. The player controls a courageous spirit who must solve puzzles to save its physical form, the student Adrian, from dying of pressure.

In the first level, the player travels through a hallway while dodging red lights, a soul-killing force, through basic controls like jump.

The second level is a gymnasium with dramatic lighting. The player must find a movable obstacle like a basketball cage and push it to jump on a higher platform.

The third level is a library with flashing red lights from a projector. The player must hide behind shelves to travel across without touching the red.

Finally, after finding Adrian drowning in a pool, the player must swim in the pool to find mechanisms and a secret tunnel that lets out the water, ultimately saving the physical form.
